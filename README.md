a) Remote and Local: Local is where we create our folders and materials and Remote means that we can access those files or folders without having the original local system which has been used to create the files.

b) Forking: Joining or making use of an already existing repositry of someone else's GitHub project or account by making a copy on our own account.

c) Cloning: Copying an existing repositry which we forked before into our local setup.

d) Push or Pull: Pushing is uploading the changes we made in any file on the local setup so that it reflects in then remote setup so that there is proper continuation of our work. Pulling is extracting any change done on another setup to properly ontinue our work.

e) Commit: It is done as a record of changes done or progress in work in github.
